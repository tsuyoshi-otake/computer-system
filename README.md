# Computer System

Computer System is a ComputerCraft-inspired programmable computer add-on for
Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

The project aims to reproduce the ComputerCraft experience as closely as the
Bedrock Add-On and Script APIs allow. Programs use a sandboxed,
MicroPython-compatible language called Computer System Python, while the
computer lifecycle, terminal, filesystem, events, networking, peripherals,
pocket computers, and turtles follow ComputerCraft-style behavior.

## Status

The project is in its architecture and bootstrap phase. See
[the implementation roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for the planned compatibility
scope and executable acceptance criteria.

Development setup and Phase 0 evidence are documented in
[the development guide](docs/development.md) and
[the feasibility matrix](docs/feasibility-matrix.md). Player-experience checks
are intentionally isolated in the
[manual verification checklist](docs/manual-verification.md).

## Planned platform

- Minecraft Bedrock Edition
- Behavior Pack and Resource Pack
- TypeScript compiled to the Bedrock Script API runtime
- A deterministic, instruction-budgeted Python virtual machine
- Vitest-based host-side unit and compatibility tests
