# Development

## Supported Phase 0 environment

- Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.26.30 or later in the 1.26 release line
- `@minecraft/server` 2.8.0
- `@minecraft/server-ui` 2.1.0
- `@minecraft/vanilla-data` 1.26.33
- Node.js 24 or later

The Phase 0 baseline intentionally uses stable Script APIs and does not require
the Beta APIs experiment.

## Commands

```text
npm install
npm run format
npm run validate
npm run deploy
```

`npm run build` creates development Behavior and Resource Packs under `dist/`.
`npm run deploy` replaces only the `computer_system_phase_0` development-pack
directories in the locally installed Bedrock GDK client. The deployment root is
`%APPDATA%\Minecraft Bedrock\users\shared\games\com.mojang`, which is the
current Windows creator-content location following the UWP-to-GDK migration.

## Headless Bedrock verification

Download and extract the official Bedrock Dedicated Server distribution, then
point `BDS_HOME` at the extracted directory. Downloading the server constitutes
acceptance of the Minecraft EULA and Privacy Policy, so the repository tooling
does not download it automatically.

```text
$env:BDS_HOME="C:\path\to\bedrock-server"
npm run test:bds
```

The runner copies the distribution into a new isolated directory under
`~/tmp/computer-system-bds/`; it never modifies `BDS_HOME`. It creates a test
world, installs both Phase 0 packs, runs the stable Script API probes twice, and
requires the Dynamic Property sequence to survive the server restart. Every
suite branch must emit a `CS_PROBE_RESULT` terminal record. The runner uses an
allowlist and keeps Xbox Live authentication enabled so no player can join the
isolated server.

The harness was verified against Bedrock Dedicated Server 1.26.33.2. Both
sessions completed with 20 computers receiving exactly 2,000 instructions over
40 ticks, and the Dynamic Property sequence advanced from 1 to 2 after restart.

Set `BDS_WORKDIR` only when an explicit empty work directory is preferred. The
runner refuses a non-empty directory and never recursively deletes it.

The remaining player-experience checks are listed in
[the manual verification checklist](manual-verification.md).

After activating both packs in a test world, run:

```text
/scriptevent computer_system:probe status
```

The script should acknowledge the probe in chat. The Dedicated Server console
uses `scriptevent computer_system:probe headless` for the automated runtime and
storage suite.
