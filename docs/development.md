# Development

## Supported Phase 0 environment

- Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.26.30 or later in the 1.26 release line
- `@minecraft/server` 2.8.0
- `@minecraft/server-ui` 2.1.0
- `@minecraft/vanilla-data` 1.26.33
- Node.js 24 or later

The Phase 0 baseline intentionally uses stable Script APIs and does not require
the Beta APIs experiment.

## Commands

```text
npm install
npm run format
npm run validate
npm run deploy
```

`npm run build` creates development Behavior and Resource Packs under `dist/`.
`npm run deploy` replaces only the `computer_system_phase_0` development-pack
directories in the locally installed Bedrock client.

After activating both packs in a test world, run:

```text
/scriptevent computer_system:probe status
```

The script should acknowledge the probe in chat. More probe commands will be
added as Phase 0 capabilities are implemented.
