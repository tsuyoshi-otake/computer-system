# Verified project rules

- Structured VM blocks must propagate `return`, `break`, and `continue` through
  `finally` using explicit continuations; tests must observe the final target
  and every executed finalizer.
- A filtered ComputerCraft-style event pull discards queued non-matching events
  before returning the first match.
- Keep host-runtime limits instance-scoped. Built-ins such as `range` must use
  the active VM limits rather than global defaults.
- On Windows, Prettier uses `endOfLine: auto` so repository-wide checks preserve
  existing line endings while still validating content formatting.
