 * content, covering the whole screen. Works on both backends — an ActionForm tree
 * and inside a `<Form>` modal.
 *
 * The texture rides the title metadata: one extra field at a FIXED offset (the
 * serializer pads the title with reserved bytes so the offset is identical on both
 * backends and for any scroll count), decoded RP-side by the single static
 * `core_ui_common.form_background`. Only the first `<Background>` in a tree wins.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * render(
 *   <>
 *     <Background texture="textures/ui/my_background" />
 *     <Text>Hello</Text>
 *   </>,
 *   player,
 * );
