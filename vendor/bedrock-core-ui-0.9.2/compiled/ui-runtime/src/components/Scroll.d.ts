 * `<Scroll>` — one independent scroll region. Each `<Scroll>` in a render becomes its own
 * scroll viewport (index 0 is the implicit root) that scrolls vertically.
 *
 * Like every other component, `<Scroll>` accepts the full {@link ControlProps} (flex sizing,
 * `flexGrow`, `margin`, `position`/`top`/`left`, …); those values size and position its
 * **viewport** in the parent's flex flow, exactly like a `<Panel>`. Arrange a group with the
 * parent's `flexDirection`, fix a size with `width`/`height`, or take it out of the flow with
 * `position="absolute"` + `top`/`left`. An un-sized, non-absolute scroll defaults to
 * `flexGrow: 1` so bare `<Scroll>`s share the parent's space.
 *
 * `visible`/`enabled`/`background` are accepted (part of `ControlProps`) but are NOT applied
 * to the viewport — the protocol carries only per-scroll geometry.
 *
 * Content NOT wrapped in any `<Scroll>` falls into the root scroll, so simple UIs need none.
 * A render may contain at most {@link MAX_SCROLLS} `<Scroll>`s.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * render(
 *   <Panel flexDirection="row" gap={4}>
 *     <Scroll width="30%">{left}</Scroll>
 *     <Scroll>{right}</Scroll>
 *   </Panel>,
 *   player,
 * );
